The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) product utilizes the rental income on the subject investment property solely to determine 
eligibility — no other borrower income is used in the loan analysis. DSCR loans are exempt from the Ability to Repay (ATR) rule as they 
are categorized as business-purpose loans. 
The program is designed for experienced real estate investors and qualifies the transaction based solely on cash flows from the 
subject property. An experienced real estate investor is defined as: A borrower having a history of owning and managing non-owner-
occupied residential real estate or commercial real estate for at least 12 months during the most recent 36-month period. For files 
with multiple borrowers, only one borrower must meet the definition.
The DSCR calculation is determined by taking the qualifying monthly gross income divided by the monthly PITIA of the subject 
investment property.
A Statement of Business Purpose and Occupancy Affidavit signed by the borrower, declaring that the property is or will be used for 
business or investment purposes only, is required.

Income
Debt Service Coverage Ratio Defined
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is the monthly gross income divided by the PITIA of the subject investment property. 
No DTI is calculated. 
Income — Lease Requirements
	
■For purchase transactions, use the lesser of the Estimated Market Rent from the 1007 or lease agreement.
	
■Unexpired executed lease is required except for purchase transactions where there is no existing lease or no existing 
lease to assign.
	
■For refinance transactions, the property must currently be leased. The Seller must document the rental income with a 
copy of the lease for the subject property. If the lease has converted to month-to-month, then provide the most recent 
two (2) months’ proof of receipt to evidence continuance of lease. If unable to provide evidence of receipt, the unit will 
be treated as vacant and ineligible for financing. For a new lease, the Seller must document the new lease, receipt and 
deposit of the security deposit and first month’s rent. The lesser of the current subject property rent or the fair market 
rent determined by the appraisal is to be used to determine the gross monthly rent.
	
■If the subject property (such as an Airbnb, VRBO or similar service) is rented on a short-term basis, the gross rental 
income is the lower of the rental value  
of the property from a rental addendum prepared by the appraiser or the average monthly rental income received from 
the short-term rental over the past  
12 months, as documented from the short-term rental facilitator. Reduce allowable LTV by 5% when using short-term 
rental income to qualify. Other requirements include:  
	–
One-unit properties only.
	–
Third-party statements from the Airbnb, VRBO or similar service must be provided. The statement must identify the 
subject property/unit, rents collected for the previous 12 months and all vendor management fees.
	–
If the subject property is a condominium, provide written evidence that the property is eligible for short-term rentals.
	–
Must be permitted in accordance with local ordinance.
